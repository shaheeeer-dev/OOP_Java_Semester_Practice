Code Readability – Practice Problems

This folder contains practice problems focused on writing clean, readable, and maintainable Java code.
The goal is to improve code quality rather than just making the program work.


🧩Problem 1: Bad Variable Naming
Scenario:  
A program calculates total marks, but variable names are unclear and confusing.

Task: 
Refactor the code to use meaningful variable names that improve readability.

Focus:
- Meaningful identifiers
- Readable output


🧩Problem 2: Method Refactoring
Scenario: 
All logic is written inside the `main` method.

Task: 
Move logic into properly named methods.

Focus:
- Method extraction
- Single responsibility


🧩Problem 3: Magic Numbers
Scenario: 
Hard-coded numeric values are used directly in calculations.

Task:
Replace magic numbers with named constants.

Focus:
- Use of 'final' constants
- Self-documenting code


🧩Problem 4: Long Method Cleanup
Scenario:
A method performs multiple tasks, reducing readability.

Task:
Break logic into smaller, readable methods.

Focus:
- Clean method design
- Logical separation


🧩Problem 5: Clean Code over Comments
Scenario:  
The code relies heavily on comments to explain poor naming.

Task:  
Improve code so that it explains itself without unnecessary comments.

Focus:
- Clean naming
- Reduced comment dependency
